# Detection_Estimation
An adaptive detection algorithm (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4104190)

This contains the important problem of CFAR detectors:

A general problem of signal detection in a background of unknown Gaussian noise is addressed, using the techniques of statistical hypothesis testing. Signal presence is sought in one data vector, and another independent set of signal-free data vectors is available which share the unknown covariance matrix of the noise in the former vector. A likelihood ratio decision rule is derived and its performance evaluated in both the noise-only and signal-plus-noise cases.

Simulation contains a comparison between the proposed LRT and Matched Filter.
